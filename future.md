# FUTURE !

1. USE GOLANG IN THE BACKEND AND JAVASCRIPT IN THE FRONTEND
2. GOLANG IS FOR BACKEND, NOT FRONTEND (And it's easier to implement)

3. On prod, cache EVERY web page template when loading the app
4. Clone the elements BELOW their template (for example, the js-element should be cloned below itself with the data to display)

## THE FUTURE of the FUTURE
1. Use a single page app (SPA) for the frontend
2. SSR
3. Better rendering (caching, etc.)
